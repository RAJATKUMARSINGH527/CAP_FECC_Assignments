            Chemistry  Assignment
        </h1>
        <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>

        <h2>
            Chemical Elements
        </h2>
        <p>The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are <br>classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>

        <h3>
            Chemical Equations
        </h3>
        <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations</i>. Here's an example of a <dfn>chemical reaction</dfn>:</p>
        <p>
            2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> â†’ H<sub>2</sub>O
        </p>

        <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (<var>H<sub>2</sub></var>) and oxygen gas (<var>O<sub>2</sub></var>) to form water (<var>H<sub>2</sub>O</var>).</p>

        <h4>
            Important Concepts
        </h4>
        <p><var>Stoichiometry</var> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.
            <br><br><sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>

        <h5>
            Conclusion
        </h5>
        <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our <br>lives.</p>
